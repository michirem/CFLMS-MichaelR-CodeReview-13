# CFLMS-MichaelR-CodeReview-13

For this CodeReview, the following criteria were graded:
- Create a nice looking responsive theme. You can use Bootstrap or just HTML/CSS. 
Implement interface for the CRUD on Events:
- Event index page: all events should be listed here like on the image above (event name, event date and time)
- Event view page: when a user clicks on the event, he/she should get an event view page with all the data stored for that event
- Event edit page: on this page, it should be possible to edit the event data
- Event add page: on this page, it should be possible to add a new event
- Event delete option: a user should be able to delete an event from the database

**Bonus Points:**
- Create filtering depending on the event type
